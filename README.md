## The problem

When teams "vibe code" with AI, context evaporates at every handoff:

1. **Dev A** spends three hours building a feature with Claude Code — plans, retries, dead ends, half-baked decisions.
2. **Dev A** stops for the day. **Dev B** opens Cursor the next morning. No idea what was tried.
3. They ask the AI; the AI hallucinates because it has no shared memory.
4. Tokens wasted. Hours wasted. Dev A gets pinged at midnight.

Static rules files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `AGENTS.md`) help, but they only carry **conventions** — never the **live state of work in progress**. That's the gap HuddleUp fills.

---

## The solution

```bash
# Dev A — before walking away
huddleup snapshot

# Dev B — picks up exactly where Dev A left off, in any AI tool
huddleup resume streaming-chat-endpoint
```

The `resume` command prints a full *YOU ARE HERE* briefing, opens the relevant files in your editor, and injects the captured context into your active AI tool. Next prompt has memory of everything. Zero hallucination handoff.

> 💡 **Token Exhaustion Protocol** — the AI tool config files HuddleUp generates carry an instruction telling the AI to auto-run `huddleup snapshot` when it's near token exhaustion (~10% remaining). So even if a human forgets, the AI doesn't.

---

## Screenshots (VS Code extension)

| Sidebar | Snapshot | Resume |
|---|---|---|
| ![Sidebar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anandsundaramoorthysa/huddleup/master/vscode-huddleup/media/screenshot-sidebar.png) | ![Snapshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anandsundaramoorthysa/huddleup/master/vscode-huddleup/media/screenshot-snapshot.png) | ![Resume](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anandsundaramoorthysa/huddleup/master/vscode-huddleup/media/screenshot-resume.png) |

The CLI works headlessly too — same commands, same data, same `.huddleup/` folder. Use whichever fits your loop.

---

## Quick start

### 1. Install

```bash
# CLI
npm install -g huddleup

# Or use without installing
npx huddleup init
```

### 2. Initialise in your project

```bash
cd your-project
huddleup init
```

This scaffolds `.huddleup/` and generates one config file per AI tool:

```
your-project/
├── .huddleup/
│   ├── charter.md          # your project's single source of truth
│   ├── config.json
│   ├── threads/            # active work threads
│   ├── history/            # append-only event log
│   └── playbook/           # reusable team patterns
├── CLAUDE.md               # for Claude Code
├── .cursor/rules/huddleup.mdc   # for Cursor
├── AGENTS.md               # for Codex / Copilot / generic
└── .windsurfrules          # for Windsurf
```

### 3. Daily loop

```bash
huddleup thread new "streaming-chat-endpoint"   # start a feature
# ...code with your AI tool as usual...
huddleup snapshot                               # save before a break
huddleup resume streaming-chat-endpoint         # tomorrow / teammate picks up
huddleup standup                                # see what the whole team is mid-stream on
huddleup archive streaming-chat-endpoint        # done — file it away
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| `huddleup init` | Scaffold `.huddleup/` and AI tool config files | Once per project |
| `huddleup snapshot` | Save current work state to a thread | Multiple times daily |
| `huddleup resume <thread>` | Load briefing + open files + inject context | Multiple times daily |
| `huddleup sync` | Regenerate AI tool files from charter | After charter edits |
| `huddleup thread new <name>` | Create a new work thread | Per feature/bug |
| `huddleup thread list` | List active threads | As needed |
| `huddleup thread show <name>` | Print a thread | As needed |
| `huddleup standup` | Team status board (active threads + today's events) | Daily |
| `huddleup handoff [user]` | Snapshot + auto-commit + notify | Explicit handoffs |
| `huddleup archive <thread>` | Mark thread complete | Per feature/bug |

`hup` is a short alias for everything: `hup snapshot`, `hup resume`, etc.

## How a snapshot is built

```
You run: huddleup snapshot
        │
        ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  AUTO-CAPTURE (zero effort):                 │
│  • git diff (staged + unstaged)              │
│  • currently open files                      │
│  • last N AI messages, detected from         │
│    Claude / Cursor / Copilot / Codex /       │
│    Windsurf session files on disk            │
│  • author, timestamp, tool used              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │
        ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ONE QUESTION (30 seconds):                  │
│  "Where did you leave it?"                   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │
        ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  .huddleup/threads/<name>.md  (markdown)     │
│  .huddleup/history/<date>.jsonl  (event log) │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │
        ▼
   git commit & push → teammate runs `huddleup resume`
```

Everything is **plain markdown + git** — no proprietary format, no backend, no MCP server, no lock-in.

## Install the VS Code extension

Search **HuddleUp** in VS Code Extensions, or get it from the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AnandSundaramoorthySa.vscode-huddleup).

Cursor / VSCodium / Windsurf users — Open VSX publish is in [the roadmap](CHANGELOG.md#unreleased).

---

## Brand

Logo, colours, and the full brand kit live in [`assets/brand/`](assets/brand/). See [`assets/brand/brand.md`](assets/brand/brand.md) for guidelines.

The mark is **Hex Huddle** — six teammates arranged in a hexagonal ring around a central huddle point. Primary colour: indigo `#6366F1`.

Re-export rasters with:

```bash
npm run build:assets
```

## Acknowledgements

Built by [@anandsundaramoorthysa](https://github.com/anandsundaramoorthysa). Inspired by the OSS dev-tools tradition of `git stash`, `git rerere`, `tmux` session save/restore, and the recent surge of "AI coding context" tools — none of which solve cross-tool team handoff.
